BBC ID3v2 Chapter Tool Version 1.4
==================================

Capabilities
------------
The application will currently accept input files using 
ID3 version 2.2 and 2.3 tags (or no tag). The output files
contain an ID3v2 version 2.3 tag.

Requirements
------------
The application has been developed using Java 1.4 and 
JMF2.1.1e but should work with later versions. Both of 
these are available from java.sun.com. If you have 
problems you can check your JMF installation by running 
the Applet at:

http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/2.1.1/jmfdiagnostics.html

The JAR file jmf.jar must be included in your CLASSPATH 
environmental variable.

Running ID3v2ChapterTool
------------------------
After unzipping the archive Windows users can launch the 
application by running ID3v2ChapterTool.bat whilst Linux 
users can run ID3v2ChapterTool.sh. An icon is provided
that can be associated with these files.

Warning
-------
ID3v2 Chapter signalling is not currently supported by most
media players. 

Although the signalling is unlikely to cause problems it 
may be some time before you will be able to see a benefit.
However, if you are developing a media player which 
supports chapters you should find this application useful.
